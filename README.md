# My First Project
This project is built mainly using JavaScript, HTML & CSS.
<br>
In this game-based project, one needs to guess a number between 1 & 20 and the system will say whether your guess was right or else it will guide you towards the right number.
<br>
Here, I've implemented a simple dynamic UI in which the background will turn green if your guess was right or if you lose the game, it will turn red.
<br>
I hope you like my simple project which I've made on the way to master JavaScript but there are still a lot more to learn & create bigger impactful projects.
